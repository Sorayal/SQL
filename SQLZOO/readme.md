# SQL ZOO 

These are simple text files which contain
my solutions for **[SQL ZOO](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)**.
These may differ from the offical solutions.

ItÂ´s a nice website where you can practice SQL statements against a database.
Thanks to Andrew Cumming for providing his website.
